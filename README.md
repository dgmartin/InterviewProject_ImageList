# InterviewProject_ImageList

This project was originally done for a job interview. I was given the following requirments:

> Please send us a sample project that displays a scrolling list of images populated from: http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=boston&amp;format=json

> This project should keep a local cache of the images in device storage so that they are available in future launches of the application without needing to be downloaded again. The application should asynchronously load the photos from the web if they are not in the cache, add them to the cache, and display them when they become available.
 
> Please take about 1 day to complete this project, and send back a zipped up project file, so we can run in and assess.

I am sharing this on github for any others that would like to see a sample of my current coding style.
